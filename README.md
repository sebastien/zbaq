`zbaq` is an incremental, de-duplicating, local or remote backup solution
that uses the [zpaq](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html) archiver. `zbaq` is
designed as a convenient wrapper around `zpaq`, making it easy to configure
and automate the tasks of backing up files, archiving backups and retrieving
their contents.
